# Notebooks for PySAL

This repository hosts several IPython Notebooks that have been used in workshops and
other educational contexts to teach scientific Python and, in particular,
`PySAL`. Here is the relation of all of them:

* `intro_scicomp_python.ipynb`: brief introduction to the main libraries for
  scientific computing in Python (`ipython`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`).
